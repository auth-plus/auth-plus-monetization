### Table Event-Price

- The table event-price should be public
- This table contains all information regard event and cost of it
- Price can be different between plan's type for the same event

### Types of plan

There will be two types of monetization: Pre-Paid and Post-Paid.

#### Pre-Paid

Pre paid organizations will paid before usage, which means that each event will be disconted on the credit. They can not buy events, they can only buy credit.

#### Post-Paid

Post paid organizations will be charged after usage, which means that each month will be calculated all events used and will be charged. All clients must choose a day to be charged except 29, 30, 31

make infra/up # already create tables based on ./db/migration folder
make infra/down # does not remove volume

# make test on the same condition where it's executed on CI
make test

# developer and test enviroment
make dev
